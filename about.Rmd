#About

<img src="pics/perfil.png" alt="Carlos' pic" style="float:right;width:150px;border:10;"> 
I am a biologist with a PhD in Ecology. During my academic training I acquired solid skills in scientific research, quantitative analysis and **<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>** programming. As a professional ornithologist I acquired extensive field experience in the Atlantic forest, Cerrado and Amazon biomes.

My main scientific interests are in population and community ecology, ornithology, data science, conservation biology and chronobiology. I am also interested in philosophy of science and quantitative approaches in general. I support initiatives of free sharing of knowledge, such as open source, free software,  and creative commons licenses.
